* Compiling
  Profiling with gprof requires the -pg compiler option for compiling
  and linking.  People have reported mixed success with profiling
  shared libraries.  It doesn't seem to work for me.  So I have to
  disable building shared libraries.  With static libraries, the tests
  don't compile.  It's probably a configuration issue that should be
  fixed.  But for now, the tests need to be disabled.

cd <source root>
./configure CXXFLAGS=-pg --enable-shared=no --enable-unit-tests=no

* Building
  Everything needs to be rebuilt, so 

make clean 
make 

* Running
  Run as usual.

cd vamos
./vamos <args> 

* Reporting
gprof vamos > <output file>

  With shared libraries, the actual executable is .libs/lt-vamos.  So
  in that case you'd give that as the argument to gprof.
