/// \brief Code for libvamos-world, the environment for cars and tracks
///
/// Cars and tracks do not interact directly.  In fact, there are no
/// dependencies between the code in Vamos_Body and the code in Vamos_Track.
/// All interactions between bodies and tracks are handled by code in
/// Vamos_World.
///
/// The event loop, input handling (joystick, mouse, etc.) and the logic for
/// computer-controlled cars are here too.
