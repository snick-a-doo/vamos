Changes since 0.7.1
2014-02-03  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Show lap times for practice.  Don't show staring lights for
	practice.

2014-02-02  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Changed license to GPL3.

2014-01-28  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Read and write race results.

2013-11-10  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Improved passing.

2013-11-07  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Edited scripts to work with Python 3

2013-10-01  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Added a model of tire heating, wear, and grip.  Added a hardness
	parameter to the tire section of the car definition file.  Greater
	hardness means less heading as a function of force transmitted.

2013-06-02  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Show the track view initially if there are no controlled cars.

2013-06-02  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Put a camera on the outside of each turn on generated tracks.

2013-06-02  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Split >180 degree curves into double-apex curves on random tracks.

2013-03-17  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Previously we would go though the other car's entire history until
	finding the entry to use for calculating the time difference. Now
	we stop looking when delta t is so large that the slipstream
	effect is negligible. This prevents a drop in frame rate when cars
	are far apart.

2013-03-17  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Define an OpenAL exit handler

2013-03-17  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	When the racing line nears the edge the calculation blows
	up. Constrain lane shift to [1.0, 1.0].

2013-03-13  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Use the track position store in Car_Information where possible

	Avoid recalculating track position by using the last recorded
	track position in the replay data.

2013-03-09  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Timing lines are added to random roads each km. Previously, no
	timing lines were added. This caused an assert to fail.

	For circuits, make the last elevation match the first to avoid
	starting on a hill.

	Don't display the lap count or fastest lap if the track is not
	closed.

2013-02-16  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Release the clutch faster at the start.

2013-02-16  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Put the brakes on until the clutch is released to avoid rolling on
	at the start of a race.

2013-01-12  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Check for a gap at more points before attempting a pass.

2013-01-26  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Swiched from state machine to event-driven driver.

2013-01-21  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Draw 2D starting lights.

2013-01-19  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Timing_Info handles timing of the starting lights.

	Robot drivers wait for the start of the race. They also have some
	random reaction time.  Avoid jitter at low speeds with the chase
	view.

	Added function to generate a random double in a range to the
	numerics.

2013-01-14  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	from that directory. Used boost::filesystem so we now depend on
	Boost even if unit tests are not built. Automake version change
	required regeneration of all Makefile.in.

	* world/Robot_Driver.cc:
	Ensure that the robot driver's target is ahead of the car regardless of
	orientation.  This prevents the robot from going backwards after a spin.

2011-08-12  Sam Varner  <snick-a-doo@comcast.net>

	Use the Fuel_Tank member pointer mp_fuel_tank to handle fuel
	consumption.  Removed the member m_fuel.

	* body/Body.cc:
	Added call to update_center_of_mass() in propagate().  This is a
	fairly expensive function, but it calling it every time step does not
	affecte performance on my machine.

	* include/vamos/body/Fuel_Tank.h, body/Fuel_Tank.cc:
	Added Fuel_Tank class.  It's a Particle whose mass changes depending
	on the amount of fuel left in the tank.

	Show the amount of fuel remaining on the dashboard.

	* include/vamos/body/Car.h, body/Car.cc: Handle fuel consumption.

	* body/Engine.cc, include/vamos/body/Engine.h:
	The engine can now report its fuel consumption.

	* body/Tire.cc:
	Updated Tire to use the modified Spring_Device; changed the sign of
	the force and added a second damping value.

	* body/Spring_Device.cc:
	Turned the damping into two variables, one for movement away from
	equilibrium and one for movement toward equilibrium.

	Changed the sign of the force calculated in propagate().

	* include/vamos/body/Spring_Device.h:
	Turned the damping into two variables, one for movement away from
	equilibrium and one for movement toward equilibrium.


	* world/Car_World.cc:

2002-01-07  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* include/vamos/body/Tire.h:
	Tire uses a Spring_Device to model the deformation of the tire under
	acceleration, braking and cornering.  A copy constructor was added so
	that the Spring_Device pointed to is copied correctly.

	* include/vamos/body/Suspension.h:
	When the compression velocity is too high (>
	m_max_compression_velocity) the damper locks up and the suspension
	does not give.  The result is a hard collision.

	* doc/vamos.info, doc/vamos.texi:
	Added some more documentation to the Physics and Simulation chapter.

	* body/Wheel.cc:
	Removed the effect of camber and caster on the position of the contact
	patch.  I couldn't figure out how to do this correctly.  I don't
	expect those corrections to have a noticable effect on the simulation
	anyway.

	* body/Tire.cc:
	Tire uses a Spring_Device to model the deformation of the tire under
	acceleration, braking and cornering.  A copy constructor was added so
	that the Spring_Device pointed to is copied correctly.

	* body/Suspension.cc: When the compression velocity is too high (>

	Use Body::lowest_contact_position() for the initial placement of the car.

	* body/Tire.cc, include/vamos/body/Tire.h:
	Tire uses a Spring_Device to model the deformation of the tire under

	that the Spring_Device pointed to is copied correctly.

	* body/Suspension.cc, include/vamos/body/Suspension.h:
	When the compression velocity is too high (>
	m_max_compression_velocity) the damper locks up and the suspension
	does not give.  The result is a hard collision.

	* body/Wheel.cc:
	Removed the effect of camber and caster on the position of the contact
	patch.  I couldn't figure out how to do this correctly.  I don't
	expect those corrections to have a noticable effect on the simulation
	anyway.

	* include/vamos/body/Spring_Device.h, body/Spring_Device.cc:
	Added Spring_Device, a class for spring-like objects.

2002-01-05  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	false when the locked condition is not met.

	* include/vamos/body/Body.h, body/Body.cc:
	Added lowest_contact_position() method.  This function returns the
	smallest z-value of the particles.

	* vamos/silverstone.cc, vamos/track.cc, vamos/trk-convert-header:
	Adjusted the gravel friction parameters.

2002-01-01  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* vamos/silverstone.cc:
	Made the Silverstone circuit a little more accurate.

	* vamos/track.cc: Made Silverstone the default track.

2001-12-29  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* body/Tire.cc:
	Removed m_slip_damp member.  This was used to provide damping for the
	slip angle.  Without it the slip angle oscillated when driving at high
	speed.  But the damping term caused instabilities.

	Added a limit to the rate-of-change of the slip angle.  This reduces
	oscillations without introducing instabilites.

	* include/vamos/body/Tire.h: Removed m_slip_damp member.

2001-12-20  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

2001-12-20  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* include/vamos/body/Car.h:
	Created an accessor gear() for m_new_gear.  This is used to find the
	last gear selected even if the transmission hasn't yet shifted into
	that gear.

	* world/Gl_Car_World.cc:
	Fixed slow clutching when shifting to second.  The intentional delay
	in shifting means that we may not actually be in second when we engage
	the clutch.  Instead of asking the transmission what gear it's in, we
	ask the car for the lask gear selected.  We should make a horrible
	grinding noise, but that might be too annoying.

	* track/Road_Segment.cc:
	Fixed a problem with Arc_Road::coordinates() that caused a crash when
	you went the wrong way around the track.

	* include/vamos/body/Tire.h, body/Tire.cc:
	Added a damping term to the slip angle.  This helps reduce slip angle
	oscillations.

	* track/Road_Segment.cc:
	Made Arc_Road::coordinates() work with curves that are longer than 180
	degrees.

2001-12-17  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* vamos/trk-convert:
	Improved the process of deciding if radians or distance is used to set
	the length of a curve.  Added code to handle degrees.  Added options
	for forcing the program to assume radians, degrees or length.

	* vamos/trk-convert-header:
	Added the file with C++ lines used by trk-convert.

	* world/Gl_Car_World.cc:

	calculation of the arguments for glOrtho.

	* include/vamos/track/Road_Segment.h:
	Made the minimum and maximum dimensions doubles because they are lengths.

	* track/Road_Segment.cc:
	Made the minimum and maximum dimensions doubles because they are lengths.

	Keep m_start_angle > 0 and < 2pi.

	* include/vamos/track/Track.h:
	Made the minimum and maximum dimensions doubles because they are lengths.

	* track/Track.cc:
	Made the minimum and maximum dimensions doubles because they are lengths.

	Fixed the build_circuit() method so that it works with clockwise
	tracks too.


2001-12-14  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* world/Car_World.cc:
	In center_position().  Return the z-position of the track rather than
	the car as the third element of the return vector.  This makes
	drop-height consistent when reset() is used.

	* vamos/mosport.cc: Added Mosport track from RARS.

	* body/Wheel.cc: Set the rotational velocity to 0.0 in reset().

	* body/Tire.cc: Set the rotational speed to 0.0 in reset().

	Added members to hold the minimum and maximum x and y dimensions.
	Their values are determined in build().

	* include/vamos/world/Gl_Car_World.h, world/Gl_Car_World.cc:
	Added window width and height members.  These members are used along
	with dimensions from the track to draw the track in map view with the
	correct aspect ratio.

	* vamos/trk-convert:
	Added a program for converting RARS track (.trk) files to C++ source
	files for used by Vamos.

2001-12-06  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	Added angle() for determining the angle between two Three_Vectors.

	* world/Gl_Car_World.cc:
	Reduced m_steer_exponent.  Reduced m_first_clutch_time.  Use
	m_first_clutch_time when shifting into reverse as well as shifting to
	first.

	* body/Wheel.cc:
	Added camber, caster, toe and steer_angle members.  Take these values
	into account when calculating the contact position.  Pass the camber
	to Tire::input().

	* body/Tire.cc:
	Removed no-longer-used m_direction member.  Added m_camber and
	m_camber_torque.  Include the effect of camber on the tire forces.

	* body/Particle.cc:
	Re-introduced the friction term in contact().  Friction is no longer
	proportional to velocity.

	* body/Clutch.cc:
	If the engine plate is rotating more slowly than the transmission
	plate, the sign of the torque is reversed.

	* body/Brake.cc: Friction is no longer proportional to velocity.

2001-11-28  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* track/Road_Segment.cc:
	Convert angle from degrees to radians in the Arc_Road constructor.

	* include/vamos/track/Road_Segment.h:
	Put the names of the Arc_Type enumeration constants in all caps.

2001-11-28  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* body/Wheel.cc:

	* body/Body.cc:
	Removed the m_inertia and m_inertia_inverse Three_Matrices.  m_inertia
	is now an Inertia_Tensor object.

	The position of the Particle and the inertia tensor are now passed to
	the Particle's contact method.

	* world/Gl_Car_World.cc:
	Decreased the default clutch time for shifting into first from 2.0 s
	to 1.0 s.

	* include/vamos/geometry/Inertia_Tensor.h, geometry/Inertia_Tensor.cc:
	Added Inertia_Tensor class for describing the inertia tensor of a
	rigid body.

2001-11-21  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* include/vamos/body/Wheel.h, body/Wheel.cc:
	Added caster and camber adjustments.  These adjustments affect the
	orientation of the Wheel's coordinate system, but they don't yet have
	any effect on handling.

	* include/vamos/body/Particle.h, body/Particle.cc:
	Added reset method for setting the force, impulse and torque to zero.

	* body/Frame.cc:
	The guts of the rotate method have been moved to Three_Matrix.
	Frame::rotate() simply calls Three_Matrix::rotate().

	* include/vamos/body/Car.h, body/Car.cc:
	Added reset methods that call Body's reset() and also re-initialize
	the engine and gearbox.

	* body/Body.cc:
	Call each Particle's reset method in Body::reset().  Added a reset
	method that takes the position and orientation of the Body as
	arguments.

	* geometry/Three_Matrix.cc, include/vamos/geometry/Three_Matrix.h:
	Added rotate (const Three_Vector& delta_theta).  This method rotates
	the matrix about the vector `delta_theta' by an amount equal to the
	magnitude of delta_theta.

	* include/vamos/world/Car_World.h, world/Car_World.cc:
	Added methods to the Car_Info class to help with reseting the
	simulation.

	center_position() returns the world-coordinate position of the center
	of the track at the same distance along the track as the car.

	center_orientation() returns the orientation matrix that would place
	the car parallel to the road.

	reset() puts the particles back on the initial road segment.

2001-11-20  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* world/Gl_Car_World.cc:
	Added m_window to hold the ID of the window so it can be destroyed
	when we quit the application.

	Added key (q) for quitting the application.

2001-11-19  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* world/Gl_Car_World.cc:
	Use Car's two-argument control methods when using keyboard controls.
	The second arument sets how long it will take for the control to reach
	its full value.

	Added members and setting methods for the controls' time values.

	* include/vamos/body/Car.h, body/Car.cc:
	Added Key_Control class for turning switched (key or button) input
	into a gradual application of the control.

	The clutch, steering, gas and brake now use Key_Control.

2001-11-14  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* include/vamos/body/Car.h, body/Car.cc:
	Removed toe in from the calculation of the steering angle.  Toe is now
	a property of the wheel.

	* body/Wheel.cc, include/vamos/body/Wheel.h:
	Added toe adjustment.  This used to be in Car.  Toe and steering are
	implemented by rotating the Wheel's frame.

	Added static constant Three_Vector STEER_AXIS for the axis of rotation
	for steering, the z-axis of the wheel's frame.

	* geometry/Three_Vector.cc, include/vamos/geometry/Three_Vector.h:
	Removed default values from three-argument constructor.  This helps
	avoid using a double where a Three_Vector is needed.  (The double was
	assigned to the x-value, y and z were assigned the default 0.0).

	Added a default constructor that takes no args and sets all elements
	to 0.0.

2001-11-10  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* vamos/Vamos_Car.cc:
	Reduced the height of the rendered block to be the same as the highest
	particles as defined in car.cc

	* vamos/vamos.cc:
	Pass in a value for gravity to Gl_Car_World now that it makes a
	difference.  Added a commented out call to the car's cm_velocity()
	method.  This is for testing collisions by throwing the car down the
	track.  Try it, it's fun!

	* world/Car_World.cc:
	Reworked the interact() method.  The collisions of the wheels with the
	road, which are softened by the suspension, are handled separately
	from the hard collisions.  Simultaneous soft collisions are handled,
	but only one hard collision per time step.

2001-11-09  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* world/Gl_Car_World.cc:
	The gravity argument to the Gl_Car_World constructor is now honored.

	* include/vamos/body/Wheel.h, body/Wheel.cc:
	Split the contact() method into wheel_contact() and contact().
	wheel_contact() handles collisions of the wheel with the road that are
	cushioned by the suspension.  contact() handles the case where the
	suspenion is at its limit.

	* body/Particle.cc:
	Commented out the friction part of the impulse in contact().  It
	relies on the bad assumption that velocity is constant over the time
	step.  I need to find another way to handle this.

	* include/vamos/body/Car.h, body/Car.cc:
	The wheel_contact() method was added because the soft wheel contact is
	now handled separately from the hard bottoming-out contact.

	* include/vamos/body/Body.h:
	Made inertia() protected so it can be used by Car.

	Added a velocity setting method.  Good for throwing the car at the
	ground to see what breaks:)

	* body/Body.cc:
	Removed actual velocity calculations.  They don't seem to make a
	difference anymore.

	* include/vamos/body/Suspension.h:
	Added m_bottomed_out member and accessor to tell when the
	suspension is at its limit.

	* body/Suspension.cc:
	Added m_bottomed_out member to tell when the suspension is at its
	limit.

	Ignore damping for voilent collisions (rate of change of displacement
	> 5.0 m/s).  I hate to set an arbitrary limit but at that rate the
	calculated damping force is unreasonable.  I'd like to find a more
	analytical way of handling this problem.

2001-10-28  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* world/Car_World.cc:
	interact(): Body::contact() returns displacement as a Three_Vector.

	* body/Tire.cc:
	propagate(): Changed the logic a little to make the similarities
	between locked and unlocked behavior a little clearer.

2001-10-28  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* world/Car_World.cc:
	interact(): Body::contact() returns displacement as a Three_Vector.

2001-10-27  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* include/vamos/body/Particle.h, include/vamos/body/Wheel.h, include/vamos/body/Body.h:
	contact(): Return the displacement of the particle as a Three_Vector.

	* body/Wheel.cc:
	contact(): Return the displacement of the particle as a Three_Vector.

	contact(): Back-project the displacment vector (dist) onto the z-axis,
	the direction of suspension travel, to get the suspension's
	displacement.

	contact(): Use the correct impulse equation when the suspension
	bottoms out.

	* body/Particle.cc:
	contact(): Return the displacement of the particle as a Three_Vector.

	propagate(): Zero the force and impulse with the zero() method.

	* body/Body.cc:
	propagate(): Transform m_gravity into the body frame outside the
	loop over the particles.  This avoids unnecessary transformations.

	propagate(): Calculate the torque with body-frame vectors.  Do the
	translations and rotations with body-frame vectors.  Using world-frame
	vectors gives the wrong transformation.  This also avoids a bunch of
	transformations.

	velocity(): Use world-frame vectors since we want to return a
	world-frame velocity.

	contact(): Return the displacement of the particle as a Three_Vector.

2001-10-25  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* include/vamos/body/Wheel.h:
	In contact(), made distance a Three_Vector that's parallel (or
	anti-parallel) to the normal.  Got rid of the normal vector argument.

	* body/Wheel.cc:
	Project the suspension force vector onto the normal vector.

	In contact(), made distance a Three_Vector that's parallel (or
	anti-parallel) to the normal.  Got rid of the normal vector argument.

	* world/Car_World.cc:
	In contact(), made distance a Three_Vector that's parallel (or
	anti-parallel) to the normal.  Got rid of the normal vector argument.

	Exclude wheels from collisions with barriers.  We shouldn't have to do
	this, but right now, wheels hitting walls causes problems.

	* include/vamos/body/Particle.h:
	In contact(), made distance a Three_Vector that's parallel (or
	anti-parallel) to the normal.  Got rid of the normal vector argument.

	* body/Particle.cc:
	In contact(), made distance a Three_Vector that's parallel (or
	anti-parallel) to the normal.  Got rid of the normal vector argument.

	Put the correct factor in the collision impulse equation now that
	(some) collisions are more stable.

	* include/vamos/body/Body.h, body/Body.cc:
	Made velocity() report the actual velocity of the body taking into
	account any collisions or other adjustments made after propagate() was
	called.   This is done by subtracting the current position of the
	center of mass at the beginning of propagte() from the previous value
	and dividing by the time step.  I'm assuming that the time step is
	about the same as the previous time step.  The members
	m_prev_cm_position and m_actual_cm_velocity were added.

	In collision, made distance a Three_Vector that's parallel (or
	anti-parallel) to the normal.  Got rid of the normal vector argument.

	* body/Wheel.cc:
	Set the m_torque member, inherited from Component, to the value
	returned by the tire's slip_torque() method.

	Added slip_torque() function for reporting the torque applied to the
	car by the contact patch when turning.

	Replaced the constant factor in sinusoidal forgiveness by
	m_forgiveness.

2001-10-22  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* include/vamos/body/Component.h, include/vamos/body/Makefile.am, include/vamos/body/Makefile.in, include/vamos/body/Tire.h, include/vamos/geometry/Makefile.am, include/vamos/geometry/Makefile.in, include/vamos/track/Makefile.am, include/vamos/track/Makefile.in, include/vamos/world/Makefile.am, include/vamos/world/Makefile.in, include/vamos/world/World.h:

	Updated track1.cc's make_road() to take a pointer to a Gl_Track, and
	to use a vector of Surface*s instead of Surfaces.

2001-10-20  Sam Varner  <spvarner@atl.mediaone.net>

	* include/vamos/track/Track.h:
	Removed trivial destructor definition for Track.  A destructor is now
	defined in the source file.

	* vamos/vamos.cc:
	Make use of the new make_wheels(), make_parts() and make_road() that
	require pointers to empty objects.

	* vamos/track.h, vamos/track.cc:
	Pass in a pointer to a Gl_Track instead of returning a Track.

	* vamos/car.h, vamos/car.cc:
	For make_wheels() and make_parts(), pass in an empty vector of
	pointers to be filled.

	* vamos/vamos.cc:
	Make use of the new make_wheels(), make_parts() and make_road() that
	require pointers to empty objects.

	* vamos/track.h, vamos/track.cc:
	Pass in a pointer to a Gl_Track instead of returning a Track.

	* vamos/car.h, vamos/car.cc:
	For make_wheels() and make_parts(), pass in an empty vector of

	* include/vamos/world/Car_World.h:
	Return const references rather than pointers from segment and surface
	acessors.

	* track/Track.cc:
	Added destructor for deleting segments.

	* track/Road_Segment.cc:
	Use const references to vectors for constructor arguments.  Tracks now
	compile much faster.

	Use vectors of pointers to Surfaces rather than actual Surfaces.

	Guard against deleting un-constructed objects and against re-use of
	deleted objects.

	* geometry/Surface.cc: Initialize all members.

	Added copy constructor.

	Guard against deleting un-constructed objects and against re-use of
	deleted objects.  Added framerate display.

	* world/Gl_Car_World.cc:
	Initialize all pointers to 0. Guard against deleting un-constructed
	objects and against re-use of deleted objects.

	Added framerate display.

	* world/Car_World.cc:
	Use a vector of pointers to Surfaces instead of a vector of Surfaces.
	Guard against re-use of deleted mp_car_info by setting to 0 in
	destructor.

	* body/Gl_Car.cc:
	In destructor, protected against deleting pointers unititialized
	members.

	* body/Body.cc:
	Added a destructor for deleting the parts.
