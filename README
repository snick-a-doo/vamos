Vamos is an automotive simulation framework with an emphasis on thorough
physical modeling and good C++ design. Vamos includes a real-time, first-person,
3D driving application.

* Requirements
  The libraries are written in C++ so you need a compiler.  Any recent GCC
  release should do fine.

  The necessary libraries are OpenGL (including glu and GLUT), SDL, OpenAL, and
  Boost.  

  The game is written in Python 3.  If Python >= 3.2 is not found the libraries
  will be built but not the game.

  A joystick is recommended but it's possible to control the car with keys or a
  mouse. 

* Building
  Use the usual GNU-style build sequence.
  
  $ tar xzf vamos-0.8.0.tar.gz
  $ cd vamos-0.8.0
  $ ./configure
  $ make

  If you like you can install with

  # make install

  but you can also run it from the build directory.

* Running
  Vamos does not have a GUI yet so you'll have to use command-line arguments.
  Before you start, you can close the program with the X or Escape key.  F9
  change the view and F4 cycles through the cars.

  To run it from the build directory, use

  $ cd vamos
  $ python vamos.py <arguments>

  Depending on your system you may need to type 'python3' to get the right
  version.

  If it's installed use

  $ vamos <arguments>

  but make sure your PYTHONPATH includes the place where the modules were
  installed.  Try something like

  $ export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib64/python3.2/site-packages

  Here are some command-line recipes
** Practice at Suzuka
   $ vamos -t Suzuka

   You can see what tracks are available by listing the files in ../data/tracks
   if you're running from the build directory or
   /usr/local/share/vamos/tracks if installed. 

** Watch the computer-controlled cars on a randomly generated track
   $ vamos -r -d -o 5

** Qualify at Spa
   $ vamos -q -t Spa -o 5 -p 10

** Race from the qualifying positions from the last qualifying sesion
   $ vamos /tmp/vamos-qualifying
