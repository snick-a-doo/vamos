There's a version of this document with pictures at
<vamos.sourceforge.net/caelum>

Usage: caelum [options] image-file.ppm
	Run Caelum, a tool for creating sky boxes.

The image file is mapped onto a sphere and six views are shown.  The
views are from the center of the sphere looking up (top row), down
(bottom row), front, right, back, and left (middle row).  When these
images are mapped to the faces of a cube and viewed from the center of
the cube, the view in any direction is indistinguishable from the view
from the center of the sphere.  The images for the sky box are
extracted by taking a screenshot.


Installation
------------

To install, copy .libs/lt-caelum to /usr/local/bin/caelum.
Caelum requires libvamos-geometry and libsigc++.  If you install Vamos
first, you should be ready to go.


Options
-------

--divisions=DIV
-d DIV	
	Specify the number of latitude divisions.  The number of longitude
	divisions is twice DIV.  The default value is 16.

--height=HEIGHT
-h HEIGHT		
	Specify the height of the window in pixels.  The height of each view
	entire window will be HEIGHT/2.  The default is 1.5 times the
	height of the source image.

--width=WIDTH
-w WIDTH
	Specify the width of the window in pixels.  The width of each view
	window will be WIDTH/4.  The default is twice the width of the
	source image.

--help
	Display a help message and exit successfully. 

--version
	Display version information and exit successfully.


Controls
--------

<Left>
<Right>
	Rotate the image about the vertical axis.

<Up>
<Down>
	Shift the image vertically.

<Page Up>
<Page Down>
	Scale the image vertically.  


Example
-------

Load the sky image from the textures directory.

	 ./caelum ../data/textures/sky.ppm

This image comes from the Sky collection at
<http://www.vb3d.com/Textures.html>.  It is not (and doesn't claim to
be) a true panorama.  As a result, the top is pinched in the center.
Using the <Up>, <Down>, <Page Up>, and <Page Down> keys you can change
the position of the horizon and make the mountains appear taller or
shorter.

When you're satisfied, take a screenshot and chop it up with
an image manipulation program such as the GIMP.  For Vamos, you need
three images, the top view, the bottom view, and the entire strip of
side views.  The sky box images are specified in the XML track files.


Possible Enhancements
-------- ------------

o The ability to write the transformed images to files would be
  useful.

o Better use of the blank space on the screen could be made by showing
  instructions, current scaling parameters, or other useful bits of
  information.
