** Bump function is not smooth across start of track.
** Don't let cars intersect.
** Check for memory leaks on reloading cars and tracks.
** Improve framerate
   Allow more cars at once.  Rendering is the major bottleneck.
   Collision handling reduces perfomance a bit for large numbers of cars.

   - F1: 6 cars @ 60 Hz fullscreen

** Fail if libraries are missing
   Also add libXi, libXmu
* Enif's Win32 issues
** Update dependencies in web docs.
   http://vamos.sourceforge.net/vamos-docs/Building-Vamos.html#Building-Vamos
** Macro guards
   In front of glu.h and glut.h includes:
   #ifdef WIN32
   # define WINDOWS_LEAN_AND_MEAN 1
   # define NOMINMAX 1
   # include <windows.h>
   #endif
** Direction enum conflicts
** Rectangle name conflicts
   Rectangle -> Vamos_Geometry::Rectangle.
* Game Support
** Add UI
** Draw lines on the track.
** Make crash sound play consistently.
* Post 1.0
** Make tires springy
** Review suspension
   - Is the current model adequate?
   - Should we handle bad settings better?
   - Handle bottoming out

* Maybe
** Draw shadows
*** Projection shadows and stencil buffer
    Glut 3.7 example
    Planar surface only.  Track may be close enough to planar.
*** Stencil buffer
    Any shape of surface
*** Fast shadows
    SIGGRAPH '92 paper Fast Shadows and Lighting Effects Using Texture
    Mapping, Mark Segal et al.
    GL_EXT_depth_texture and the GL_EXT_texture3D extensions or OpenGL
    1.2 are required.

    Have GL_EXT_texture3D, GL_SGIX_depth_texture and
    GL_ARB_depth_texture.  Good enough?
